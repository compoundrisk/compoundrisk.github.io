<p><strong>Alternative aggregation option 1: Mean</strong></p>
<p>An alternative method of aggregation is to use an average across all source indicators. This can be done in a number of ways. The simplest is to use a regular arithmetic mean, which assigns an equal weight to all source indicators.</p>

<p><em>A second related option is to take an average of grouped indicators.</em> Here, source indicators are assigned in relation to whether they reflect changes in underlying risk capacities (represented by <span class="math inline">\(CapacityNorm_{c}\)</span>) or outcomes (<span class="math inline">\(OutcomeNorm_{o}\)</span>).

<p>Or using a geometric mean, as recommended by Guillaumont (2009) for risk analysis where grouped outcomes are likely to multiply.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[RiskDimensionMaxGeo_{r} = \ \sqrt[2]{\max_{c = 1\ldots n}\left\{ CapacityNorm_{c} \right\}\  \cdot \max_{0 = 1\ldots n}\left\{ OutcomeNorm_{o} \right\}}\]</span></p>

In addition, <em>choice of geometric mean takes into account the fact that capacity and outcome related measures are likely to compound</em> (i.e. they have a multiplicative relationship rather than an additive one).

<p><strong>An alternative to the aggregation method for calculating Overall Compound Risk flags is to apply a filter. In this way, instead of calculating a combined average of Emerging Threat and Underlying Vulnerability, Overall Compound Risk is flagged on the basis of whether both of the two source inputs are considered high or medium risk.</strong> For example, the most basic filtering system for Overall Compound Risk designates a given dimension as high risk if both Emerging Threat and Underlying Threat scores are scored as 10 (i.e. high risk). All remaining values would be classified as ‘not high risk’.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[OverallCompoundRisk_{r} = \ \left\{ \begin{matrix}
HighRisk \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ EmThreat_{r}\mathbf{=}10\mathbf{\ AND\ }UnderVul_{r} = 10 \\
\\
NothighRisk\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ EmThreat_{r} &lt; 10\mathbf{\ OR\ }UnderVul_{r} &lt; \ 10 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ \ \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[OverallCompoundRisk_{r} = \ \left\{ \begin{matrix}
HighRisk\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ EmThreat_{r}\mathbf{=}10\mathbf{\ AND\ }UnderVul_{r} = 10 \\
\\
NothighRisk\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ EmThreat_{r} &lt; 10\mathbf{\ OR\ }UnderVul_{r} &lt; \ 10 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ \ \]</span></p>
<p><strong>While the method above is simple and clear to understand, it results in far fewer risk dimensions being flagged compared to the aggregate method – largely because it requires thresholds to be breached both in relation to Underlying Vulnerability and Emerging Threats.</strong> A more practical measure may involve lowering the critical threshold for designating dimensions as high risk (similar to the use of 7 rather than 10 as that threshold in the aggregation method). While this provides greater comparability with the aggregate method, as well as a broader spread of high-risk countries, it inherently involves some degree of subjectivity given that there is no empirical rationale for the selection of 7 as a cut-off (as opposed to 10 which implies that source indicators are above expert-derived thresholds).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[OverallCompoundRisk_{r} = \ \left\{ \begin{matrix}
HighRisk\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ EmThreat_{r} &gt; 7\mathbf{\ AND\ }UnderVul_{r} &gt; 7 \\
\\
NothighRisk\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ EmThreat_{r} &lt; 7\mathbf{\ OR\ }UnderVul_{r} &lt; \ 7 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ \ \]</span></p>
<p><strong>A final measure seeks to add further nuance by recognizing dimensions that that are just below the threshold for high risk.</strong> In this way, the filtering system separates alert levels according to high, medium and low risk – without the need to aggregate underlying vulnerability and emerging threat. The system is very similar to designations listed under the quadrant heatmap shown in Annex Figure X.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[OverallCompRisk_{r} = \ \left\{ \begin{matrix}
HighRisk\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ EmThreat_{r} &gt; 7\mathbf{\ AND\ }UnderVul_{r} &gt; 7 \\

\end{matrix} \right.\ \ \]</span></p>
<p><strong>This is much closer to the general approach adopted by the CRM – though note that all filtering approaches result in an categorical alert levels (rather than numeric scores ranging from 0–10).</strong> For this reason, we use the <em>aggregation</em> method as a default for calculating Overall Compound Risk in the CRM, though allow users to choose alternative methods using the online interactive dashboard (including filtering) based on preferences.</p>

<p><strong>Aside from the global risk maps, there are a wide range of descriptive analyses that can be used to unpack findings from the CRM. Heatmaps are an example of visual tool that helps to convey a holistic picture of risk conditions for countries and risk dimensions.</strong> As a reminder, the CRM provides three country-level risk profiles for each of the six risk dimensions. These include measures of: Underlying Vulnerability; Emerging Threats; and Overall Alert Flags. All three scores are broadly related. In particular, Overall Alert Flags are made up of a combination of the Vulnerability and Emerging Threat scores, acting as a gauge of the vigilance required in monitoring ongoing risk conditions in the coming months. Having said that, each score can be viewed as a stand-alone, covering different aspects of risk of relevance to decision makers. As such, the CRM is designed to provide information for range of different user-needs: whether highlighting countries predisposed to compound crises (Underlying Vulnerability); identifying countries where risk conditions are likely to deteriorate rapidly (Emerging Threats); or gaining a general sense of upcoming compound risk hotspots in the months ahead (Overall Alert Flags).</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps the easiest way to understand the relationship between the three measures is to plot heatmaps for each risk dimension (and country).</strong> Figure 6 shows country-level profiles for all six risk dimensions by plotting Underlying Vulnerability on the X-axis against Emerging Threats on the Y-axis. Dots represent individual country scores (in instances where multiple countries have the same score dots are scaled according to the number of countries). A selection of random countries is highlighted to show case where different types of countries fall within the heatmap. Heatmaps can also be used to assess the risk profile of individual countries as shown in Annex Figure 5. Shaded regions denote Overall Alert Flags, showcasing which risk category a country falls under, ranging from high-alert in red (representing Alert Level scores between 7–10) medium-alert in orange (scores of 5–7) and low-alert (0–5). Regions are shaded according to the default procedure used in aggregating Overall Alert Flags: a geometric average of Underlying Vulnerability and Emerging Risk. Alternative aggregation procedures are shown in supplementary heatmaps found in Annex Figures 3 and 4.</p>
<p><strong>The heatmaps in Figure 6 show a number of interesting traits. Firstly, the distribution of scores varies considerably across the six risk dimensions. This largely reflects the different nature of underlying indicators and thresholds used.</strong> For example, most risk dimensions feature country scores that are evenly scattered across the heatmap as indicators used to populate Vulnerability and Emerging Threat elements are continuous (both in relation to raw data and normalized thresholds). However, some appear more segmented. For example, the wide horizontal spread between dots in the Conflict dimension reflects the fact that underlying vulnerability for conflict risk is represented by a binary variable (i.e. whether a country is on the FCS list or not). While there are good reasons for limiting the conflict risk to the FCS variable (further outlined in Box X) this results in a stark spread of values in the heatmap and highlights the limitations of the current approach. It is for this reason that aggregation of Overall Alert Flags is carried out using an arithmetic mean as opposed to a geometric mean (as can be seen by the different risk classification shadings in the Conflict heat map). This accounts for the fact that countries not included on the FCS list (and therefore an Underlying Vulnerability score of 0) would only ever be classified A low alert status – irrespective of the country’s Emerging Threat score. As such, the arithmetic mean allows for non-FCS country with an Emerging Threat score of 10 to be classified as medium-alert status instead (note that is not possible for a non-FCS country to be grouped as high alert).</p>
<p><strong>The heatmaps are also useful in revealing implications of aggregation in determining Overall Alert Flags.</strong> The default in the CRM is to use a geometric mean using values for Underlying Vulnerability and Emerging Threats. The shaded regions in the heatmap reveal how different combinations of scores result in high, medium and low alert outcomes. For example, countries classified as high alert tend to be those that have generally have high scores on both Vulnerability and Emerging Threat elements of the CRM. Looking closer to the boundary, countries can also be classified high alert if they score a 10 in one of the axes (Threat or Vulnerability) and 5 in the other.</p>
<p><strong>It is these boundary cases that are of most interest when it comes to classifying countries.</strong> In using a geometric mean as the CRM’s default, clear judgement calls are apparent in looking at the shaded regions of the heatmap. For example, a country that scores a 10 on one of the axes and a 0 on the other would be classified under a low alert level. This is done to reflect the fact that the CRM is an early warning system pointing to overall levels of vigilance needed in responding to changing risk conditions. With that in mind, a country that has very high levels of vulnerability to fragility (such as Afghanistan) but currently experiencing a dramatic fall in conflict-related deaths would be placed under low alert – recognizing that conflict related risks are likely to be reduced in the coming months <em>compared to expected norms</em>. With the same example in mind, use of a different aggregation procedure, such as an arithmetic mean (show in Annex Figure 3), would mean that no matter what current conditions are being experienced a highly vulnerability country (i.e. an Underlying Vulnerability score of 10) would always be classified under the medium or high alert bracket. Returning to use of a geometric mean, a country that has experienced a recent uptick in disease outbreaks (say as doubling of COVID-19 deaths from 20 to 40), but has a highly effective health care system would similarly be placed under low alert. This is done to recognize the country’s high levels of resilience in dealing with the threat – though it is worth pointing out the limitations of this approach if the threat is exceedingly large.</p>
<p><strong>While choice of aggregation procedure can have important implications for designating Overall Alert Flags, it is important is important to note that all three scores will be shown under the CRM database and dashboard – allowing users to get a holistic picture of threat conditions and make judgements based on their own needs.</strong> Similarly, users will be able to choose between different aggregation procedures (such as geometric and arithmetic means) allowing them to tailor the CRM to given preferences.</p>

<p>Heatmaps present information from three scores related to Underlying Vulnerability (X-axis), Emerging Threats (Y-Axis) and Overall Alert Level (shaded areas).

All shaded areas are derived according to a geometric mean, aside from conflict which is devised using an arithmetic mean.</p>
</div>
<p>In order to further probe key outputs and methodological options within the CRM we analyse the large amount of analytical data produced by the early warning system. As mentioned above, the main focus of the analysis is on the CRM’s underlying vulnerability and emerging threats outlooks – though comparisons are also drawn to the overall risk measure where relevant (alongside more detailed descriptions in Annex Supplementary Text 1 and Annex Table 6).</p>
<p><strong>A first step in uncovering insights from the CRM is to compare how levels of underlying vulnerability correlate with emerging threats. Figure 10 shows a count plot comparing scores from the two outlooks (with further disaggregation by region).</strong> The plot suggests that the relationship between the two variables is modest (with a correlation coefficient of 0.32). In general, countries that are historically predisposed to multi-dimensional threats are often those likely to be affected by numerous emerging threats. However, there relationship differs across continents. While the relationship is positive in Africa, Europe and to a certain extent Asia, trends are somewhat negative for the Americas and Oceania. The latter implying that many countries with low emerging threats flags are currently experience high emerging threats conditions (and vice versa).</p>

<p><strong>We can probe this further by looking at correlations between emerging threats and underlying vulnerability dimensions (Figure 11).</strong> Here we see two important factors. Firstly, most risk dimensions appear to be positive correlated. Clear exceptions can be seen with regards to emerging Health risk. This may be suggestive of the fact that Health threats are currently experienced in countries that are otherwise less-affected by other multi-dimensional threats (and vice versa) – a trend that appears consistent with the current spread of COVID risk, as many countries in Europe and North America struggle to contain the virus. A second clear observation is that scores across the six underlying vulnerability dimensions are more highlight correlated than for emerging threats dimensions. While this may reflect the nature of current risk conditions, it may also be partly due to fact that underlying vulnerability dimensions tend to feature a heavy use of multi-dimensional indexes (that are likely to overlap slightly across different dimensions). This is one of the reasons why case should be taken in direct comparisons between underlying vulnerability and emerging threats (particularly as it relates to the combined overall risk score).</p>

Red boxes correspond to a positive correlation, while blue boxes reflect negative associations. Box marked with an X are not statistically significant. Dimensions with an ‘ET’ relate to Emerging threats while those labelled ‘EV’ relate to Underlying vulnerabilities.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Another important point of comparison is to look at different risk outcomes using the various methodological options for aggregation outlined in the methodology (Section 2).</strong> As highlighted above, the current default in the CRM is to aggregate country-level risk dimension scores by taking the maximum value across the series of source indicators. This method is chosen because it provides decision makers with a conservative estimate of compound risk. It is also simple to understand and transparent, particularly when calculating overall levels of compound risk.</p>
<p>However, a number of alternatives were laid out in Section 2.1. One notable option is in calculating compound risk dimension scores as an average of all grouped indicators within each risk dimension. This can either be done use an arithmetic or geometric mean – the latter of which tends to be favored in other multi-dimension risk indexes such as INFORM, especially when indicators are gathered across aspects of exposure, sensitivity and response capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 12 plots country-level changes in scores and ranks between max value and geometric means for the Health risk dimension. Left hand columns show country rankings using the default max value system, while right hand columns show rankings with a geometric mean (i.e. mean values across all grouped indicators for Health risk).</strong> As is clear from the plot, mean values tend to be somewhat lower than the max value approach – perhaps unsurprisingly given the bread of indicators used. A similar feature can be seen when comparing histograms between max value and mean approaches across the other risk dimensions (as seen in Annex Figure 2). This is one of the reasons why classification levels using means are far lower (and somewhat subjective) when compared with the simplicity of max value classifications (as all values of 10 simply meant that at least one of the grouped indicators is above the designated threshold). Rankings can also differ considerably, especially as many high-risk countries under the max value approach are prone to dropping down significantly when using means. As a reminder, the strengths and limitations of the two approaches is discussed in Section 2.5.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>Note: Graphs compare country rankings for two different methods of calculating Health risk using a max value and geometric mean of underlying vulnerability and emerging threats. Labels for a subset of countries are included for illustrative purposes. Green lines indicate countries that have a reduction in score when moving from max to geometric approaches, while red lines showcase countries with increased scores.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Another important diagnostic is to consider the role of missing values. As mentioned previously, a large number of source indicators are geographically concentrated (whith decent coverage in some regions and none in others).</strong> To look at the influence of missing values on risk scores we devise an additional metric (termed a ‘Reliability Score’) that calculates the proportion of missing values used in constructing both emerging threats and underlying vulnerability scores. A reliability score of 1 implies that 100% of source indicators consist of missing values. The reliability scores will be made accessible in accompanying the main CRM outputs allowing users to gauge the quality of data inputs through the dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 13 shows that reliability scores drop relatively sharply as the number of multi-dimensional risks increase. In other words, countries that are at higher risk of compounding threats tend to have greater availability of source indicators; lower risk of compounding threats have poorer data availability.</strong> The effect is far more pronounced in the Emerging threats score, with a negative trend witness across all five continents. This reflects that fact that risk monitoring databases are typically concentrated on coverage in high-risk areas (such as FEWS NET). While this presents a challenge for robust measurement of risk in lower-risk countries, it is at least reassuring that the trend does not run in the opposite direction (i.e poor coverage in riskier countries).</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Finally, we consider whether variation in scores across source indicators may result in skewed classification of high-risk threats. In doing so, we calculate the coefficient of variation for each country and each dimension of compound risk.</strong> This is done by dividing the standard deviation of all source indicators in a given dimension by the mean. Essentially, this tells us whether indicators are consistent when assigning risk dimension scores. A high score implies that the indicators are less likely to agree and/or point in the same general direction (a lower score shows greater consistency across source indicators).</p>
<p><strong>Figure 14 reveals the distribution of country-level cofficients of variation across three emerging dimensions of compound risk<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>. In most cases, there doesn’t appear to be a strong trend – implying that variation amongst source indicators across the spectrum of risk scores is relatively consistent.</strong> If anything, trends are somewhat negative, suggesting that high risk scores have lower variation across source indicators. It is also important to note that considerable variation exists, particularly in relation to high-risk scores (i.e. 10).</p>

<li id="fn22"><p>Percentage point differences for both 2020 and 2021 are used in the current iteration, recognising that the knock-on implications of increased unemployment (and poverty) on household-level vulnerability can persist for long periods of time. Continued use of 2020–2019 figures will be actively considered in consultation with Poverty GP and the Development Data Group (and likely to drop in the later quarters of 2021). Thresholds in percentage point differences are different for the periods 2021–2020 and 2020–2019 owing to the differential impacts of the COVID crisis on socio-economic vulnerability. While large increases in unemployment (and poverty) are expected during the latter period, the former is characterised by lower growth rates as most countries are assumed to experience a relative rebound in conditions.<a href="annex.html#fnref22" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
